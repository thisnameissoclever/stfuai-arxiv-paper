I'm NovaSafo. Silicon Valley is in the San Francisco Bay area, Silicon beach in Southern California. Both are powerhouse tech hubs. In addition, the Los Angeles area is historically a hub for aerospace and defense contractors. These worlds are converging more than ever. So far this year, la defense tech companies have raised $4 billion in funding, more than double last year's haul. That's according to Los Angeles Times tech reporter Queenie Wong. She told me venture capital firms are increasingly embracing military focused tech. Some of what experts have said is there has been sort of like this shift in sentiment, especially with the new administration where people are more open to. Supporting the use of AI in the military. And also there's just a lot of money to be made because when you're. A VC firm, you're looking for the. Potential for growth and you're also looking for a return on your investment. And with these contracts, you know, some. Of them total like billions of dollars through several years. Sometimes it's hundreds of millions of dollars. And it's also sort of like an opportunity for these tech companies to develop technology and advance AI and they could use those learnings and apply it to what they're building for consumers. And so what are some of these startups in the Los Angeles area particularly? And you focused on the Los Angeles area because it is showing such a dramatic shift there, right? In development of this kind of cross pollinating of aerospace, defense and high technology. Yeah, I mean it's a, it's sort of like the hotbed for defense tech and role. They develop like a software that kind. Of serves as a command center for. Managing like autonomous vehicles and weaponry on the battlefields. They had like a $2.5 billion funding round this year and that made up a huge chunk of, you know, the more than $4 billion that VCs had poured into LA based defense tech companies. Mock Industries was another company that's helping to build autonomous missiles and weaponry. And my colleague Lawrence, he had went to go visit that company. It's being headed by a 21 year old. So some of these people are very. Young, they're straight out of college. Especially with the tech environment right now where there's a lot of layoffs, they see this sort of as an opportunity to build a business and also. Sort of stay relevant at this time in tech. It's kind of striking that a 21 year old has, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars in funding coming in and Pentagon contract. To kind of at least experiment, right, and figure some of their technologies out. Is the Pentagon kind of kind of speeding out contracts in a way that it hadn't been before? That particular contract I think was with the US army, if I'm correct. There was announcements throughout this year in. Which the Department of Defense had announced several contracts that had like a ceiling of up to $200 million. And Google was one of them. OpenAI was one of them. There's also a lot of AI companies here in Silicon Valley that people might not necessarily know of, like scale AI. For example, the CEO went to Meta to work on what they call superintelligence. They're also working with the Department of Defense and there's been like partnerships in. Which the US army are recruiting executives. To act as part time advisors and swearing them in. So it's definitely ramped up this year, especially from the previous years. Have tech rank and file workers expressed. The kind of reservations that they had in the past or are our attitudes shifting? I think it sort of depends on who you talk to. The resistance is still, still there. Like there have been protests, especially with Microsoft had announced that they were cutting certain cloud services to the Israeli military because there were workers that protested, especially after a report by the Guardian had come out and said that Microsoft Azure, which is a cloud computing platform that was being used, according to the Guardian report, to house the cause of Palestinians. And so there was a lot of concerns that there was military surveillance being used for a product created by Microsoft in some ways. And so there has been resistance in which workers from Google and Microsoft have protested contracts, especially with Israeli government or military. And some of them have risked getting fired. We'll be right back. This episode is brought to you by Intuit QuickBooks in business, cash flow isn't just a number. It's the heartbeat of your operation.

We're back with Queenie Wong, tech reporter at the Los Angeles Times. When you talk about the shift that's happened with venture capital firms getting in less hesitant to fund these startups that are involved in defense kind of applications, when did this really begin? And is there something we can pinpoint as an inflection point? I don't know if there was an exact inflection point. I mean, there have been a lot. Of geopolitical conflicts like the war in Gaza, for example, the war between Russia and Ukraine, very high profile events that have spurred a lot of spending in the defense tech sector. There has been like this long history. Of this partnership between military and tech. I mean, you think about the precursor to the Internet that was a project funded by the Defense Department. You think about gps. There are technologies being used today by consumers that had their start in the military or defense world. So the partnerships have always been there. I think people have been more vocal. To announce new ones. And then there's also partnerships in which you have a company like Meta, for example, which people think of as, you know, a way to share photos with friends and families. They're partnering with Anduril to help build headsets for the military. Some of these companies that you normally would think are used for gaming or social media, they're also kind of dipping their toes in the defense world as well. How much do we really understand about the companies and the extent of their involvement with the military and with the full scope of their projects? Yeah, I think that some of the concerns from the tech workers that maybe. The products that they're building that they think are going to be used for consumer technology, like maybe like you're building image recognition for helping to identify objects in photos could be used by like a drone, for example, to identify objects on a battlefield. And so the companies themselves, like Google for example, has kind of pushed back on the idea that somehow the work that they're doing the government is harming, you know, Palestinians, for example, in Gaza. And some of what these tech companies say is that they're just trying to help modernize government systems and not necessarily that they're trying to help the military target certain areas. That was Queenie Wong at the Los Angeles Times. We'll link to her story about the growth in defense tech on our website, marketplacetech.org Jesus Alvarado produced this episode.

They had like a $2.5 billion funding round this year and that made up a huge chunk of, you know, the more than $4 billion that VCs had poured into LA based defense tech companies. Mock Industries was another company that's helping to build autonomous missiles and weaponry. And my colleague Lawrence, he had went to go visit that company. It's being headed by a 21 year old. So some of these people are very. Young, they're straight out of college. Especially with the tech environment right now where there's a lot of layoffs, they see this sort of as an opportunity to build a business and also.",

Which the Department of Defense had announced several contracts that had like a ceiling of up to $200 million. And Google was one of them. OpenAI was one of them. There's also a lot of AI companies here in Silicon Valley that people might not necessarily know of, like scale AI. For example, the CEO went to Meta to work on what they call superintelligence. They're also working with the Department of Defense and there's been like partnerships in. Which the US army are recruiting executives. To act as part time advisors and swearing them in. So it's definitely ramped up this year, especially from the previous years.",
