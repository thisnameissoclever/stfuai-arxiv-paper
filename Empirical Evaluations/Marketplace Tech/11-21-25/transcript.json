The holiday shopping season is here, and AI companies are pushing new chatbot retail partnerships. But can these tools deliver on their promise to make shopping easier? We'll get into it on today's Marketplace TechBytes Week in Review. Plus the return of vine, the beloved video app known for its ultra short absurdist memes. But first, Meta is not a monopoly. So ruled a federal judge this week in the longstanding antitrust case against the social media giant, which claimed Meta had stifled competition by by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. Here to talk about all this news is Paresh Tavey. He's a senior writer at Wired. This is telling tech companies, big tech companies like Meta, like Google, maybe you can get back to spending again, you can get back to acquiring other companies. But I think the bigger implication is for this new generation of big companies like in OpenAI, that is dominating the field of sort of AI chatbots. They have 800 million weekly users, pretty close to that 900 million number of Facebook back in 2012. That's kind of telling OpenAI, maybe you're free to go out, acquire smaller AI companies, keep growing that way, even though you're dominant. There's all this competition. And OpenAI can point to that Meta core ruling and point to the fact that it has about the same users and say we can buy other companies and it's not, not an antitrust violation. Right. And this is kind of the second big antitrust case that has sort of Gone big tech's way. Of course, Google was declared a monopoly in its search business. But the remedy that the judge ordered. Was pretty light, was something, you know, they didn't have to spin off Chrome browser. You know, it was kind of within the realm of what was going to be okay for Google, I guess. Yeah, it was almost a sort of remedy that affected Google's partners who were a lot smaller or some of them a lot smaller, more than it affected Google in some ways. All right, well now we want to. Get into a story that you reported for Wired Paresh on the big trend of agentic shopping. Many of the big AI platforms OpenAI Google this week perplexity did kind of a relaunch of this feature for AI shopping. They've all announced these in recent months and now it's happening. The super bowl of shopping is upon us. Black Friday, Black Friday and the Black Friday season I guess you could call it. And you did sort of a survey of the landscape. What did you find, like what's out there and how are these tools working? The takeaway here is if you're one of the one in five Americans who are ready to give up all of your shopping to agentic AI, you're kind of out of luck. You know, if you want to be able to say to ChatGPT, for instance, find a perfect Christmas gift for my 10 year old niece and order it, ship it to her, it's not that quite easy. You're going to be prompted at several steps along the way for more information and you're not going to be able to have the agent check out for you and complete the purchase without you confirming the purchase. And the issue is these systems are not very reliable. We know that using these every day. And there's still a lot of disagreement between the AI companies and the e commerce companies about the best ways to conduct these transactions, the best ways to share data between the two of them. How much chat history should the e commerce companies companies get? How much customer data should the AI companies get? And as all that discussion plays out, it's going to be a while before consumers can have a truly ajuntic kick my, you know, feet up and relax kind of shopping experience. Do people want to give up the whole end of the process there of making a decision on what to buy and handing over their credit card to a bottle? Well, that was one of the interesting findings for me is that it does seem like there's a decent amount of consumers that are ready for that, at least for everyday purchases. Basic things there is some demand for that. Expedia, for example, told me that they have this integration with ChatGPT that provides up to date flight and hotel pricing information. We're still in the early adopter phase, but the usage of that tool, which is you have to tell ChatGPT explicitly Expedia or something like that to get it to prompt. They were surprised that it's getting more usage than they expected to start with. You can't actually transact there. Again, you have to click and go off to Expedia to make a purchase. But the fact that there is some adoption for that and that the adoption is higher than expected is giving Expedia a lot of excitement about where this is going. This issue of the data and who gets access to which data tell us a little bit more about what the friction is there for retailers and the chatbot platforms. Yeah, these platforms, the chatbot platforms are very intimate in nature. Right. We generally feel comfortable telling chatbots things we might not say to a sales representative on the floor in a store. And as a result the chatbot companies want to protect that privacy and so they want to limit that the information that they are sharing with e commerce companies. But then e commerce companies want to personalize our experiences and make it really fun and engaging and perfect it for us. And so they want more data than you have the actual customer data like your credit card info, your email address. Amazon is running an experiment right now where they do not give your real email address to e commerce companies where they make agentic purchases. I can't imagine those shops are happy with that. We'll be right back. Picture trying to cook a five course meal with broken equipment and expired ingredients. That's what it's like having to rely on legacy systems. You work twice as hard and get inferior results for your business. Now picture a kitchen in perfect working order.

You're listening to Marketplace Tech. I'm Megan McCarty Carino. We're back with Paresh Davey, senior writer at Wired. All right, well now we want to take a bit of a trip down. Memory lane back to the innocent days of the early 2010s. Our brains were barely rotting back then. And that is when vine became a thing. This was kind of the er, short form video app and it is apparently making a comeback promoting Fresh. Do you remember Vine? Were you using it? Yeah, I posted a couple videos, I think. So I actually went on this new tool trying to find them. I couldn't, but they apparently were only able to archive and recover some of the videos. Right. Because this was, it was acquired by Twitter and then it was shut down in 2017 apparently. Now former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is one of the backers of this comeback app called Divine D I V I N E. And the sort of selling point I guess is that it is going to be exclusively human made content. No AI allowed. Do you think this will work? They're going to use AI to try to keep AI out? Yes, I mean that might work. Will the experiment of getting people to use vine again work? Yeah, I'm not sure it's a nice science experiment or one of many that Jack Dorsey is currently funding through his nonprofit, you know, several messaging apps, several other social networking apps. You know. Yeah, nice science experiments and maybe a creative challenge for creators, but it's hard to imagine a lot of usage. Yeah, I mean, I think I like the idea of, you know, platforms kind of marketing themselves as AI slop for. I feel like that is going to be, you know, kind of a continuing strain that we might see as these platforms just become overwhelmed with AI and there's the incentive to, to do that is so high on all the platforms because they do get engagement at this point. You know, even when I see something and I know that it's AI and I become dismayed and disillusioned, you know, I still looked at it because it's, you know, it pulls people in. There's, it's just, it's, it's a very easy thing to engagement farm with. So yeah, having having these bastions of AI freedom on these kinds of platforms that are content driven does seem like a potential, you know, thing that we might see more of. Yeah, but as you noted, I mean, I'll acknowledge that counterpoint that people, people seem to be Interested in some AI swap and has OpenAI application CEO BG Simo said to my colleague in a story this week. Like it's kind of paternalistic for people to say that AI slop is bad because, you know, that's someone's creativity. And they, you know, we should have a minimum. You know, there's no sort of minimum bar for creativity. That was Paresh Davey at Wired.

            "text": "This is telling tech companies, big tech companies like Meta, like Google, maybe you can get back to spending again, you can get back to acquiring other companies. But I think the bigger implication is for this new generation of big companies like in OpenAI, that is dominating the field of sort of AI chatbots. They have 800 million weekly users, pretty close to that 900 million number of Facebook back in 2012. That's kind of telling OpenAI, maybe you're free to go out, acquire smaller AI companies, keep growing that way, even though you're dominant. There's all this competition. And OpenAI can point to that Meta core ruling and point to the fact that it has about the same users and say we can buy other companies and it's not, not an antitrust violation.",

We generally feel comfortable telling chatbots things we might not say to a sales representative on the floor in a store. And as a result the chatbot companies want to protect that privacy and so they want to limit that the information that they are sharing with e commerce companies. But then e commerce companies want to personalize our experiences and make it really fun and engaging and perfect it for us. And so they want more data than you have the actual customer data like your credit card info, your email address. Amazon is running an experiment right now where they do not give your real email address to e commerce companies where they make agentic purchases. I can't imagine those shops are happy with that.",
