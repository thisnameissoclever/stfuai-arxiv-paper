A decade since 3D printing came to the prosthetics industry, and it still hasn't brought costs down from American public media. This is Marketplace tech. I'm Megan McCarty Carino. Prosthetic limbs can be pricey, costing thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. So the industry seemed ripe for disruption when 3D printing came along. The technology requires little labor and uses economical materials. But the reality of 3D printing Prosthetic limbs isn't that straightforward, according to writer Britt Young, who uses a prosthetic arm and wrote about this recently for IEEE Spectrum magazine. Around 10 years ago, people started approaching me and asking me for my opinion on 3D printing because I've been wearing, at the time, prosthetic limbs or a prosthetic arm for my whole life. And it was around 10 years ago when it started to enter the public consciousness as a revolutionary way to cut costs and increase accessibility. You could potentially, out of your own garage, make your own high tech Iron man esque prosthetic limb, and that would be a fraction of the cost than a conventionally available prosthetic limb. And this is sort of, kind of true, not, not quite true. A lot of these designs are not very durable, they're not very comfortable, they are made of pretty cheap plastic, and obviously they're not made by professionals, so they're not professionally fitted. 3D printing now is giving you more sophisticated sockets at the professional level at your prosthetist, but it has yet to cut the costs. So why hasn't this lowered costs? So for one, what we're really dealing with is something called additive manufacturing, and at the professional level that means a over $1 million machine, and that machine requires a tremendous amount of upkeep. The firm also must pay for, just like the rest of us, licensing and subscription fees to software. And they also have to pay an enormous air conditioning bill to keep the 3D printer in a climate controlled environment. And all of this is adding up to quite a bit of cost for the prosthetics firm. However, they are able to see more patients and while they are asleep, they are able to print multiple prosthetic limbs overnight. But at the moment, the cost to them are still a bit higher than the traditional methods. One of the factors that you describe as being a barrier to reducing cost actually has nothing to do with the actual devices, but how insurance is, is covering them. Can you tell me more about that? In the prosthetics space, it is very difficult to be approved for relatively new technologies. And by relatively new, I mean within the last several decades for upper body prosthetics, insurance is fickle. In my own experience, I try to get approved for a very cheap, very simply made plastic attachment for what is called an activity arm. So this is not a chargeable electronic device. This is just a kind of plug and play attachment. I try to get approved for this to do weightlifting and the insurance company says, well, it's not necessary. I think to myself, well, don't they want us to exercise? Isn't that like, isn't that necessary? And yet I can't be approved for these kinds of attachments. So it's pretty difficult. And the logic is not always clear and the experience between individuals is vast. And was that a 3D printed attachment or do you have any experience kind of navigating this specific 3D prosthetic market? I was, I was, I was trying to possibly get a 3D printed arm from Open Bionics, which is a British firm that is now providing prosthetics internationally. They're expanding in the United States. And yet I wouldn't be able to get my insurance to approve it. And I think that it's not that 3D printing, 3D printed prosthetics are, are better. It's not that they do something or are capable of doing things that traditional prosthetics could never dream of. It's, it's not, it's not that. It's just that there's a new material out there. And because there's a new material out there that can increase the availability in the market, it's, it's good that the 3D printed devices are, are joining the market. There's just more to be had. But the barriers are the same regarding insurance. We'll be right back. This episode is brought to you by Intuit. QuickBooks in business, cash flow isn't just a number.

You are listening to Marketplace Tech. I'm Megan McCarty Carino. We're back with writer and UC Berkeley lecturer Brit Young. So what do you think would need to change in order for 3D printing to actually deliver on the promise of cheaper prosthetics? I think the greatest barrier to access in prosthetics right now has to do with our working legal definition of medical devices. So the reason that I am requesting my insurance to pay for an ABS plastic prosthetic attachment is because these devices are billed at around 700 or $800. I don't imagine they cost more than $20 to produce, but because they are medical devices, that is how they are billed. But if we were able to in ways that allowed people to stay safe, especially for implants, you know, for prosthetics like artificial hips, we of course want those devices to be safe and tested by the fda. But for external devices, the kinds of things that, you know, I use in my day to day life, I think we need to be thinking about them as more similar to the sorts of things that you can buy at Walgreens, like walkers, like wrist braces or knee braces. We have an aisle in Walgreens for these types of devices and yet they're not considered medical devices and they're not considered prosthetics. There's a strange artificial boundary around some of these things. And if we were to change the legal definition of them, we would actually be able to increase accessibility. The American healthcare system obviously has its own idiosyncrasies. But I'm curious if, sort of on a global level, you think that 3D printing will ever deliver on, you know, the promise of reducing the cost of these devices? So that's what's actually really interesting about 3D printing. For a while, the dream has been bringing 3D printing and I mean the kinds of hobbyist devices that have been in people's garages for a little bit now, to the global South. And there are a number of charities and development organizations that are doing this. They're bringing low cost 3D printers to different parts of the world, especially war torn regions, to try to help them develop low cost and quickly printable prosthetics. Many of the prosthetists I spoke to have said one of the main real benefits of 3D printing is that kind of knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing in parts of the world that may be harder to get to. But the major limitation seems to be just the skills, who is available out there to do these fittings. Some organizations set up 3D printing wherever it is that they're working in the Global south or in low resourced countries and they teach them how to do a 3D scan and then that scan actually gets sent back to the prosthetics firm in the UK or in the United States and then shipping, shipping it back out. I'm not sure if that's a very sustainable model, but I'm glad that that is a new avenue for people who may otherwise never receive a device. So bottom line, do you think that this technology will successfully bring costs down at some point? You know, I'm not sure. I think that there are very powerful forces in the United States that want to keep medical costs high. However, if we are able to work together in pushing for a new regime around prosthetics and thinking about these devices in a totally different way, that they are not something that needs, you know, 10 doctors to be approved for, that they are simply assistive devices, and that all of us, disabled or able bodied, all of us use assistive devices every day, if we're able to rethink that, then perhaps we can realize a world where these devices and 3D printing can actually make a difference.

And they also have to pay an enormous air conditioning bill to keep the 3D printer in a climate controlled environment. And all of this is adding up to quite a bit of cost for the prosthetics firm. However, they are able to see more patients and while they are asleep, they are able to print multiple prosthetic limbs overnight.

They're expanding in the United States. And yet I wouldn't be able to get my insurance to approve it. And I think that it's not that 3D printing, 3D printed prosthetics are, are better. It's not that they do something or are capable of doing things that traditional prosthetics could never dream of. It's, it's not, it's not that. It's just that there's a new material out there. And because there's a new material out there that can increase the availability in the market, it's, it's good that the 3D printed devices are, are joining the market. There's just more to be had.",

            "text": "I think the greatest barrier to access in prosthetics right now has to do with our working legal definition of medical devices. So the reason that I am requesting my insurance to pay for an ABS plastic prosthetic attachment is because these devices are billed at around 700 or $800. I don't imagine they cost more than $20 to produce, but because they are medical devices, that is how they are billed. But if we were able to in ways that allowed people to stay safe, especially for implants, you know, for prosthetics like artificial hips, we of course want those devices to be safe and tested by the fda. But for external devices, the kinds of things that, you know, I use in my day to day life, I think we need to be thinking about them as more similar",

For a while, the dream has been bringing 3D printing and I mean the kinds of hobbyist devices that have been in people's garages for a little bit now, to the global South. And there are a number of charities and development organizations that are doing this. They're bringing low cost 3D printers to different parts of the world, especially war torn regions, to try to help them develop low cost and quickly printable prosthetics. Many of the prosthetists I spoke to have said one of the main real benefits of 3D printing is that kind of knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing in parts of the world that may be harder to get to. But the major limitation seems to be just the skills, who is available out there to do these fittings. Some organizations set up 3D printing",
