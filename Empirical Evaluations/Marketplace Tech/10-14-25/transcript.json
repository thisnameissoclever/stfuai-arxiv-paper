In immigration cases, high tech gadgets are employed as alternatives to detention. But a new report says they're not necessarily more humane. From American public media, this is Marketplace Tech. I'm NovaSafo. Countries all over the world, including the U.S. use technology like check in apps on smartphones and angle monitors to keep track of immigrants released from detention centers. The idea is to allow people to live in communities while their cases are adjudicated. But a new report finds the technology is often employed in ways that that are too intrusive and connect, like digital shackles. Co author Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University in Toronto said even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims. I've spoken, you know, to individuals who've been in detention who, for example, have found it very difficult to be able to meet the reporting requirements of these applications because sometimes people don't have access to smartphones or the technology or software that is necessary for a phone to operate this type of application. And so we can imagine that a person who's already stressed about wanting to make these reporting requirements happen sometimes is thwarted by the very technology that's supposed to be assisting them. The other area is also the kind of psychosocial impacts of increased surveillance that, you know, disaggregates it kind of from the carceral or detention facility, but it actually brings it into your home. It's literally in your pocket. It's your cell phone that is tracking You. And there's something kind of uniquely difficult about this particular moment that we're trying to also uncover in the report. Yeah, your report mentions the phrase the invisible leash. Can you tell me about the use of that phrase and where you got it? So the invisible leash is referring to kind of experiences from people with technology at the border and in immigration detention settings. And we talk about Mariela as the person who crossed into Arizona, a composite person, but based on real accounts that we were told. And, you know, people like Mariela talk about the fact that, again, these technologies are not just apps or pieces of hardware or software, but it's something that kind of follows them along. And there's a lot of psychosocial impacts that also go into the way that people interact with this technology. Right. If people, for example, miss a scan as a result of bad WI Fi or bad connection, does that mean deportation? Does that mean detention? There's a lot of uncertainty for people because a lot of this technology is also very new and is not often publicly scrutinized. You know, I found one case you mentioned in your report particularly instructive in terms of understanding the psychological effects. And that was a story of actually an immigrant named Sam out of the UK and he was dealing with a glitchy ankle monitor. And the quote. I'm going to read the quote because it was very powerful. He said, I suddenly felt anxious to leave the house in case I knocked it while out somewhere. I began to move through the world more carefully. My world contracted. My mental health went into free fall. I realized I wasn't free. I was in an outside prison. That's really hard to read. Is that the kind of psychological effects you're talking about, that people feel that they're still incarcerated, essentially, but digitally versus, you know, in a physical space? Yeah, that's exactly it. It's this kind of digital incarceration that a lot of people reflect on and just how onerous and difficult it is. I mean, and when we think about the fact, again, that even a cell phone can actually become this kind of mode of detention, it's something that is always with you. You always have to interact with it. When we're not even talking about, you know, the. The kind of technology that Sam was referring to, ankle bracelets or ankle shackles that people have had on their body 24 7. I mean, it is very. The impacts psychologically are. Are. Are very hard. It makes me think back to, you know, years ago when I was litigating in Canada as a lawyer. A lot of my practice used to be immigration detention. And there were some high profile cases of people who even back then, this was nearly 10 years ago. They were kind of given the opportunity to leave traditional detention and have these ankle bracelets put on. And back then they were even more onerous. And now they have to be plugged into the wall for hours at a time. And all of the people who were in this pilot project willingly went back into kind of physical detention because they found the kind of digital incarceration so onerous and also so difficult on their families, their children, their spouses. So again, like sometimes technology is presented as an alternative or a solution, but it actually exacerbates a lot of the problems in an already broken system. That is really striking to hear because you mention that that is the argument right, for these digital tools, is that, well, isn't it more humane than holding people in detention centers, especially when a lot of times they can be quite overcrowded? We've seen those problems in the United States in the past. So. Why isn't it more humane than holding people, you know, in detention? Well, I think it's important to kind of disaggregate some of the categories of technology, which is something that our report tries to do. You know, there's the kind of surveillance technology that we were talking about, and then there is reporting applications and tools that are sometimes that could actually be, you know, whether you look at it from an empowerment perspective or from an efficiency perspective, actually better than the current system. Because of course, we don't want people incarcerated also in a very expensive system, because we're talking about immigration detention being something extremely costly. Oftentimes these alternative uses of technology can be cheaper, more efficient, and also give people back some of the urgency. But it's about how they are created and how they're developed. But it's actually also about the process of who gets designed, what these technologies look like and what they're actually doing to real people. Because it's. I think it's too simplistic to say that all technology and integration is harmful and bad. There are definitely examples of tech that can be used to ameliorate this system and actually prevent people from going into detention. But it's important to differentiate between these different categories as well. We'll be right back. This podcast is supported by Odoo.

You're listening to Marketplace Tech. I'm NovaSafo. We're back with Petra Molnar of York University, who co authored a global study of looking at the use of various technologies to keep track of immigrants. You did this global survey. What examples did you find of technology being used in ways that you find useful and good for the process? You know, at first it was really hard because we were looking at some of the really like the sharpest edges of the kind of technological development that we see in immigration at the border. And it was really hard to come up with kind of good use cases. But there are definitely some that can, for example, make access to legal advice and information easier. Especially if it's mobile platforms and applications that are multilingual, that provide real time legal updates, case specific reminders, educational content. But tools that are tailored specifically to the mobile community. They can be really, really helpful. There's also kind of psychosocial tools that we've been looking at ways to, for example, enhance information for specific groups of people on the move. LGBTQ asylum seekers, for example, come to mind, or women who are fleeing domestic violence. And then the last kind of group of technologies I'll briefly mention is also what we kind of call participatory and community design technologies. So these are technologies that are actually developed for and by refugees and people on the move. So, for example, coming up with different solutions to problems that have been identified in mobile communities is actually really powerful because again, it's not about the technology being good or bad, but it's about how it's used and who gets to actually design and develop it. And so much of this is about the fact that mobile communities, refugees, immigrants are not often at the table when we talk about technology and technological innovation. And so what we wanted to leave the reader off with, with the report is to kind of have this more forward looking perspective and also introduce some of these examples that actually show that when technology is designed with experts with lived experience, it can actually be part of an empowerment process as well. And to make the system more efficient and transparent and fair. One thing I want to make sure we emphasize, the folks we're talking about here are, I think a lot of times when we talk about immigration, whether it's legally legal, undocumented, illegal immigration gets kind of lumped all into one. The people you're talking about are, as you mentioned, refugee seekers, asylum seekers. These are folks who come into a country, whether the United States or elsewhere. And then there's this entire process. Right, and there could be detention involved and monitoring involved as that process plays out, sometimes years long, right? Yeah, that's correct. And globally, we've been seeing a rise of detention as a practice which is not only ineffective, but it's also very costly. But really what we are talking about are people who are exercising their internationally protected right to seek asylum and have that asylum adjudicated according to the rules and regulation in whatever jurisdiction that they're in. And so if we're looking at technological solutions as an alternative. And you're talking about scrutiny of the technology, what would that look like? In order for it to be more effective, what would that scrutiny look like? Yes, one of the things that we do in the report as well is provide a set of 10 guiding principles. Everything from needing to make sure that these technologies are human rights, respecting that they minimize the type of data that's collected, and always center privacy. But also there are principles about accountability and transparency. And the fact that so often in the immigration setting, we find out about these technologies after the fact, whether it's journalists or lawyers or researchers. There is this kind of opacity to the system where states are able to experiment with technologies without transparency and public accountability at all. And I think that's something that has to change in order for the system to be transparent about what types of technologies are being used and why we all need to have an opportunity to learn about them and become aware of the fact that these technologies are happening not after the fact, but maybe even before they are introduced. That was Petra Molnar, Associate Director of the Refugee Law Lab at York University. We'll have a link to her full report on the use of technology for immigrant surveillance on our website MarketPlaceTech.org Jesus Alvarado produced this episode.

But a new report finds the technology is often employed in ways that that are too intrusive and connect, like digital shackles. Co author Petra Molnar of the Refugee Law Lab at York University in Toronto said even smartphone apps, which can be glitchy, are a challenge for immigrants who are often waiting on asylum claims.",

And so we can imagine that a person who's already stressed about wanting to make these reporting requirements happen sometimes is thwarted by the very technology that's supposed to be assisting them. The other area is also the kind of psychosocial impacts of increased surveillance that, you know, disaggregates it kind of from the carceral or detention facility, but it actually brings it into your home. It's literally in your pocket. It's your cell phone that is tracking You. And there's something kind of uniquely difficult about this particular moment that we're trying to also uncover in the report.",

And we talk about Mariela as the person who crossed into Arizona, a composite person, but based on real accounts that we were told. And, you know, people like Mariela talk about the fact that, again, these technologies are not just apps or pieces of hardware or software, but it's something that kind of follows them along. And there's a lot of psychosocial impacts that also go into the way that people interact with this technology. Right. If people, for example, miss a scan as a result of bad WI Fi or bad connection, does that mean deportation? Does that mean detention? There's a lot of uncertainty for people because a lot of this technology is also very new and is not often publicly scrutinized.",

And that was a story of actually an immigrant named Sam out of the UK and he was dealing with a glitchy ankle monitor. And the quote. I'm going to read the quote because it was very powerful. He said, I suddenly felt anxious to leave the house in case I knocked it while out somewhere. I began to move through the world more carefully. My world contracted. My mental health went into free fall. I realized I wasn't free. I was in an outside prison. That's really hard to read. Is that the kind of psychological effects you're talking about, that people feel that they're still incarcerated, essentially, but digitally versus, you know, in a physical space?",

And it was really hard to come up with kind of good use cases. But there are definitely some that can, for example, make access to legal advice and information easier. Especially if it's mobile platforms and applications that are multilingual, that provide real time legal updates, case specific reminders, educational content. But tools that are tailored specifically to the mobile community. They can be really, really helpful. There's also kind of psychosocial tools that we've been looking at ways to, for example, enhance information for specific groups of people on the move. LGBTQ asylum seekers, for example, come to mind, or women who are fleeing domestic violence. And then the last kind of group of technologies I'll briefly mention is also what we kind of call participatory and community design technologies. So",

So, for example, coming up with different solutions to problems that have been identified in mobile communities is actually really powerful because again, it's not about the technology being good or bad, but it's about how it's used and who gets to actually design and develop it. And so much of this is about the fact that mobile communities, refugees, immigrants are not often at the table when we talk about technology and technological innovation. And so what we wanted to leave the reader off with, with the report is to kind of have this more forward looking perspective and also introduce some of these examples that actually show that when technology is designed with experts with lived experience, it can actually be part of an empowerment process as well. And to make the system more efficient and transparent and fair.",

Everything from needing to make sure that these technologies are human rights, respecting that they minimize the type of data that's collected, and always center privacy. But also there are principles about accountability and transparency. And the fact that so often in the immigration setting, we find out about these technologies after the fact, whether it's journalists or lawyers or researchers. There is this kind of opacity to the system where states are able to experiment with technologies without transparency and public accountability at all. And I think that's something that has to change in order for the system to be transparent about what types of technologies are being used and why we all need to have an opportunity to learn about them and become aware of the fact that these technologies are happening not after the fact, but maybe even before they are introduced.",
