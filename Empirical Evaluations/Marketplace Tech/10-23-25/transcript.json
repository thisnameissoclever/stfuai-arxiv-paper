From American Public Media, this is Marketplace Tech. I'm NovaSafo. The promise has been titillating quiet electric taxis to taking off vertically, floating over urban traffic. Consulting firm McKinsey says in a matter of five years, flying taxi fleets could rival airlines in size. Well, maybe it's already taking longer than predicted. And Marketplace's Henry Epp has been tracking the industry and its evolution. Startups started working on building these aircraft and the idea was that they would be really quiet, that they would be all electric, that they could sort of work in an urban environment. And these companies have raised billions of dollars in some cases and they've developed real aircraft, I should say. I live in Burlington, Vermont. There's one of these companies called Beta Technologies that is located just a few miles from me and I see their planes doing test flights overhead from time to time. So they have these aircraft in development, but they're still waiting to be certified by the FAA in order to actually carry out commercial flights with paying customers on board. I have to ask what do they look like and I guess not sound like when you see them flying overhead. Yeah, so it's these really kind of smaller gleaming white planes with sort of standard wings, but you don't hear them coming. They're really quiet. So you have to sort of be on the lookout for them and be aware that they're going to fly overhead. Yeah, very interesting. So I understand that at some point the military got involved with this industry. How did that happen? And what's that landscape like? Sure. So the air Force created this program called Agility prime back in 2020. And part of the impetus for it was that it had watched China become really dominant in drones, in drone technology. And the leaders in the Air Force at the time really didn't want the US to also fall behind on air tax. And so the Air Force used this program to help fund some of these companies. They gave tens of millions of dollars in some cases. And so having that military backing also really helped some of these startups raise even more money from investors because it, you know, gave them some legitimacy. The military also tested air taxis for their own use, but they didn't exactly give them a ringing endorsement. To sort of explain what happened, here's Sergio Cicuta, who's a managing partner of SMG Consulting, which works with companies in this industry. They tested the electric vehicles and they said, great, we don't have any missions for them or the set of mission these guys can do. It's very limited. Okay, so I gotta ask, why didn't the military have any use for electric aircraft? So two words, range and payload. These are battery powered aircraft. Batteries are really heavy and they can't fly as far as aircraft powered by jet fuel. They're also really limited in terms of how much weight they can carry. And the military essentially said we'd be more likely to use a hybrid version of these aircraft, which would go farther and carry more stuff and it would use, you know, conventional jet fuel instead of batteries to power still these electric motors. The military also would have more use for aircraft that could be flown autonomously. So without a pilot, that's another long term goal of these companies. But the technology is still a ways off.

You're listening to Marketplace Tech. I'm NovaSafo. We're back with Marketplace's Henry Epp, who's been following the electric flying taxi industry and its recent pivot to hybrid technologies. This is starting to sound a lot like the auto industry and how it's headed. So is that how these companies have. Pivoted to kind of? Yeah. So the military sort of started signaling hybrids would be better for us. And so in the past year, the three leading US Companies in this space, which includes Beta here in Vermont, as well as Archer and Joby, they've all announced these plans to make hybrids aimed at the military market. And to be clear, the military is not buying these aircraft yet. They have not made orders for them. But just the indication that they're interested has been enough to bring more investors on board. So. So, for example, one company, Archer, raised several hundred million dollars after announcing a defense line last year. Beta, another startup, partnered with GE this summer to build hybrids that came with an equity investment of $300 million. So in the short term, they're adding this new product line of hybrids and they're getting an influx of money to. Do it and maybe some military applications in the short, medium term. And then what about the rest of us, the mere mortals in the civilian world? When what are the plans for air track taxis? What does the look ahead look like? Well, so, you know, if this industry had had its way and the way it thought things were going years ago, you know, these would already be available to us. But it's just taking way longer than they expected to get certification from the faa. That means it takes more money than these companies thought to actually get to this flying car, air taxi future. And that's where these hybrids for defense come in and the investor money that they've brought along. Here's Elon Head, who's a reporter at the industry publication the Air Current. Without this, you know, kind of new investor enthusiasm for defense tech and defense applications. I think a lot of these companies might be struggling for money at this point. Basically they now have this bridge, some Runway, if you will, which will help them get to that air taxi, flying car future, but also gives them this sort of more diversified product line that could maybe bring them, you know, more revenue in the near term.

And these companies have raised billions of dollars in some cases and they've developed real aircraft, I should say. I live in Burlington, Vermont. There's one of these companies called Beta Technologies that is located just a few miles from me and I see their planes doing test flights overhead from time to time. So they have these aircraft in development, but they're still waiting to be certified by the FAA in order to actually carry out commercial flights with paying customers on board.",

            "text": "So the air Force created this program called Agility prime back in 2020. And part of the impetus for it was that it had watched China become really dominant in drones, in drone technology. And the leaders in the Air Force at the time really didn't want the US to also fall behind on air tax. And so the Air Force used this program to help fund some of these companies. They gave tens of millions of dollars in some cases. And so having that military backing also really helped some of these startups raise even more money from investors because it, you know, gave them some legitimacy. The military also tested air taxis for their own use, but they didn't exactly give them a ringing endorsement. To sort of explain what happened, here's Sergio Cicuta, who's a managing partner of SMG Consulting, which works with companies in this industry. They tested the electric vehicles and they said, great, we don't have any missions for them or the set of mission these guys can do.",

They're also really limited in terms of how much weight they can carry. And the military essentially said we'd be more likely to use a hybrid version of these aircraft, which would go farther and carry more stuff and it would use, you know, conventional jet fuel instead of batteries to power still these electric motors. The military also would have more use for aircraft that could be flown autonomously. So without a pilot, that's another long term goal of these companies. But the technology is still a ways off.",

But it's just taking way longer than they expected to get certification from the faa. That means it takes more money than these companies thought to actually get to this flying car, air taxi future. And that's where these hybrids for defense come in and the investor money that they've brought along. Here's Elon Head, who's a reporter at the industry publication the Air Current. Without this, you know, kind of new investor enthusiasm for defense tech and defense applications. I think a lot of these companies might be struggling for money at this point. Basically they now have this bridge, some Runway, if you will, which will help them get to that air taxi, flying car future, but also gives them this sort of more diversified product line that could maybe bring them, you know, more revenue in the near term.",
